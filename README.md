# Portfolio Generator using Node.js

![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

For this project I used Node.js to build a program that creates an HTML portfolio page, without ever touching an HTML file. Instead, I used the command line to capture user input and place it in a JavaScript function that provides the finished HTML page as output.
